    "### Simulate Tree\n",
    "\n",
    "To simulate the tree, we will use the function ``generate_simulated_full_tree``. This function will begin with a single cell and every generation create two offspring (i.e. at the end we will be left with $2^D$ cells). Every time a cell divides, we first create mutations -- this process entails considering every character and mutating to a state, specified by the mutation map, if we draw a probability less than the mutation probability specified. At the end of the experiment, we subsample ``sub_samp`` percent of the cells from the total $2^D$ cells. The parameters we use here are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **D**: The depth of the tree, or number of generations to simulate \n",
    "- **C**: The number of characters to simulate\n",
    "- **S**: The number of states per character allowed.  \n",
    "- **sub_samp**: The proportion of cells to sample at the end of the simulatoin\n",
    "- **M**: The per character mutation rate (i.e. Cas9-cutting rate). \n",
    "- **mutation_map**: This will be a nested dictionary for every character, storing the relative propensities to mutate to a given state. Many models can be used, here we use a simple negative binomial model. \n",
