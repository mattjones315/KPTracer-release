class Node:
	"""
	An abstract class for all nodes in a tree. 

	Attributes:
		- name: name of node (this will either be some internal identifier or the cellBC)
		- char_vec: the array of character states, ordered by character.
		- char_string: a string representation of the char_vec, delimited by '|'. Used for quick comparisons between node character states.
		- pid: process id (useful for disambiguating between identical character states traversed on different parts of the tree)
		- is_target: boolean value indicating whether or not these nodes are targets or not.
		- support: float value indicating support of node

	Methods:
		- get_character_string: utility function for getting character string
		- get_name: utility for getting the name of the node
		- get_character_vec: utility for getting the character vector
		- get_edit_distance: calculate the edit distance between two nodes
		- get_modified_hamming_dist: calculate hamming distance between nodes, taking into account mutagenesis process
		- get_mut_length: get a 0 - 1 value indicating the proportion of non-missing characters are different between two nodes
