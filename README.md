Code &amp; utilities for the manuscript "Lineage Recording Reveals the Phylodynamics, Plasticity and Paths of Tumor Evolution"

You can find notebooks, scripts, and data necessary for reproducing the results for each figure in the folder entitled `reproducibility`. Note that this code may not reproduce the exact figures presented in the manuscript in the future due to version updates and stochasticity in some procedures. To note, we now support several of these procedures in the [Cassiopeia](https://github.com/YosefLab/Cassiopeia) codebase now (e.g., fitch hartigan maximum parsimony and evolutionary coupling) and encourage interested users to use Cassiopeia.  We hope that nonetheless this code is useful for other researchers who may want to use similar concepts in their analysis.

Note: The Cassiopeia version is out of date with the main `master` branch in our [repository](https://github.com/YosefLab/Cassiopeia) and for this reason we include the Cassiopeia version used for the analysis reported in our [manuscript](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.10.12.464111v1).
